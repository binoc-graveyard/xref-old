                    <p>It's possible to search through an entire source text;
                    or to search for files whose name matches a pattern; or to search
                    for the definitions of particular functions, variables, etc.</p>
                    <p>The individual files of the source code are formatted on the fly
                    and presented with clickable identifiers.  An <em>identifier</em> is a
                    macro, typedef, struct, enum, union, function, function prototype or
                    variable.  Clicking on them shows you a summary of how and where they
                    are used.</p>
                    <p>The <em>free-text search</em> command is implemented
